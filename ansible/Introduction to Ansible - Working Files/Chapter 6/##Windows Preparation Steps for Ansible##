##Windows Preparation Steps for Ansible##
1. Launch a Windows Server 2012 R2 Base ec2 instance
2. Add an inbound rule to your security group for port 5986
3. Download a RDP client if you're not using a Windows machine.  I'm using Microsoft Remote Desktop
4. Decrypt the default Administrator password by pasting the contents of your .pem file into AWS.
5. Input the public IP address, username=Administrator, and password into your client and then connect to your Windows machine
6. Open up a PowerShell window and type Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
7. Type notepad in your PS window to open up notepad
8. Copy and paste the contents of the ps script found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/stable-2.0/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1
9. Save the file with the .ps1 file extension
10. Execute the script in your PS window by navigating to it and just kick it off with .\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1  It should return OK at the end.
11. In your vagrant instance, create a project directory called windows
12. Inside your windows directory, create a group_vars directory
13. Inside your group_vars directory, create a file called windows
14. In that file, place the following variables:
ansible_user: Administrator
ansible_password:  YourPassword
ansible_port: 5986
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
15. Save the file and go up one directory and create a hosts file
16. Inside that hosts file, create a windows group and then place the public IP or domain name of your host.
17. Test connectivity with ansible windows -i hosts -m win_ping*

*Note: depending on your control machine, you may need to install a couple packages.  Here are the steps to correct errors:
apt-get install python-pip
pip install xmltodict
pip install pywinrm
